# Visual Computing & 3D Workshop

## Workshop Summary

This repository documents the work completed for the Visual Computing & 3D Workshop. The primary goal of this workshop is to integrate key concepts from 3D graphics and computer vision into a series of practical, hands-on exercises. The topics explored range from fundamental image processing and color theory to real-time 3D rendering and gesture-based interaction.

Each exercise is implemented as a self-contained module, demonstrating specific techniques and principles. The projects utilize a variety of modern technologies, including Python with OpenCV for computer vision tasks and React Three Fiber for interactive 3D graphics on the web.

## Exercise 2 — Digital Eyes (Filters and Edges with OpenCV)

### Objective
Understand the basic flow of visual perception in digital images: grayscale conversion, smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection using different methods.

### General Description
An image was loaded and the following steps were applied:  
1. Conversion to **grayscale**.  
2. Application of **smoothing (blur)** and **sharpen** filters.  
3. Edge detection using the **Sobel X**, **Sobel Y**, and **Laplacian** operators.  
4. (Bonus) Use of **interactive sliders** to adjust parameters in real time with **cv2.createTrackbar** and live visualization with the webcam.

### Analysis of Differences Between Methods
- **Blur (smoothing):** reduces noise and fine details, ideal for preprocessing.  
- **Sharpen:** enhances edges and contrasts, but may amplify noise.  
- **Sobel:** detects directional edges; useful for vertical (X) and horizontal (Y) gradients.  
- **Laplacian:** computes the second derivative; detects edges regardless of direction, though it can be more sensitive to noise.

### Prompts Used
- "Que métodos proporciona OpenCV para aplicar blur, sharpen y Sobel? "
- "Como funciona y como puedo aplicar cv2.createTrackbar?"  

### Personal Comments
- **Learning:** I understood how filters highlight or smooth specific features of an image.  
- **Challenge:** Achieving a good combined visualization of edges without saturating the image.

##  Exercise 4 — Image = Matrix (Channels, Slicing, Histograms)

###  Objective
Manipulate pixels and image regions directly, exploring how color channels are represented and how brightness and contrast adjustments influence the result.

###  General Description
1. Separation of **RGB** channels and conversion to **HSV**.  
2. Region editing through **slicing** (zone modification and copy/paste of sections).  
3. Generation of **intensity histograms**.  
4. Adjustment of **brightness and contrast** using `cv2.convertScaleAbs()`.  
5. (Bonus) Local interactive sliders to modify brightness and contrast in real time.

### 📸 Evidence

### Exercise 5 — Rasterization from Scratch

- **Brief Explanation:**  
  This notebook implements three classic rasterization algorithms **from scratch**, without using any high-level graphics libraries (only **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**).

- **Implemented Algorithms:**

  - **Bresenham’s Line Algorithm:** Efficiently draws lines using only integer operations.
    - **Core Idea:** Move step by step along the X-axis, calculating an error term to decide when to increment Y — avoiding multiplications or divisions.
    - ![Bresenham](./assets/5/bresenham.jpg)
  - **Midpoint Circle Algorithm:** Rasterizes a circle by exploiting its **octagonal symmetry**, computing only one octant and reflecting points to complete the full shape.
    - **Core Idea:** Start from (0, r) and increment x. A decision parameter `p` determines whether the next point lies inside or outside the ideal circle. The results are reflected across 8 octants.
    - ![Midpoint](./assets/5/punto_medio.jpg)
  - **Scanline Triangle Fill:** Fills a triangle **row by row**, intersecting its edges with each horizontal scanline.
    - **Core Idea:** Sort vertices by Y, compute intersections for each row, and fill pixels between left and right intersections.
    - ![Scanline](./assets/5/scanline.jpg)

- **Personal Comments:**
  - **Learning:** This exercise provided insight into how modern rendering systems approximate continuous geometry through discrete pixels — the foundation of real-time 3D graphics.
  - **Challenges:** Ensuring pixel accuracy without floating-point errors was key, especially for steep lines and edge cases in the scanline algorithm.

### Exercise 9 — Visual Filter (Custom Convolutions)

- **Brief Explanation:**  
  This exercise implements a **manual 2D convolution** and compares the results against OpenCV’s `cv2.filter2D`. Three different kernels were designed to explore common image filtering operations.

- **Implemented Kernels:**

  - **Sharpen:** Enhances fine details and edges.
  - **Blur:** Reduces noise by averaging neighboring pixels.
  - **Edge Detection:** Highlights contours and intensity transitions.
    - ![Filters](./assets/9/lena_filtros.jpg)

- **Code Description:**  
  The program downloads the classic _Lena_ image, converts it to grayscale, and applies a **custom 2D convolution** by sliding a kernel (weight matrix) across each pixel. The manually computed output is then compared with OpenCV’s built-in convolution results, displaying both side by side.

- **Link to Code:**

  - [View Convolution Code](./ejercicios/09_convoluciones_personalizadas/)

- **Personal Comments:**
  - **Learning:** Implementing convolution from scratch clarified the foundation of many computer vision and deep learning techniques.
  - **Challenges:** Managing image borders and normalizing pixel intensity values were the main technical difficulties.

### Exercise 10 — Exploring Color & Interactive Materials

- **Brief Explanation:** This exercise explored digital color representation in two parts. The first part used Python and OpenCV to analyze color models (RGB, HSV, LAB), visualize their channels, and simulate conditions like color blindness. The second, optional part, applied these concepts to a 3D environment using React Three Fiber, where an object's PBR material properties (color, roughness, metalness) were controlled in real-time through an interactive UI.
- **Key Results (GIFs):**

  - [React Three Fiber (3D Scene)](./ejercicios/10_modelos_color_percepcion/threejs/)
- **Personal Comments:**
  - **Learning:** A key insight was understanding how abstract color spaces like HSV have practical applications in vision tasks. The 3D part provided a tangible visualization of PBR material properties, connecting theory with immediate visual feedback.
  - **Challenges:** The main challenge in the Python section was correctly applying the linear algebra for the daltonism simulation. For the 3D part, debugging dependency issues in the web environment was the primary hurdle.

### Exercise 12 — Webcam Gesture Control

- **Brief Explanation:** This project implemented a real-time gesture control system using Python and MediaPipe. The initial version focused on core gesture recognition: counting raised fingers and detecting a "pinch" by measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger. These gestures were mapped to control the color, size, and position of a circle. The project was then extended into a bonus minigame where the user must "pop" a randomly appearing target by moving their hand and using the pinch gesture.
- **Key Results (GIFs):**

|       V1: Gesture Controlled Object        |        V2: "Pop the Target" Minigame        |
| :----------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |

- **Link to Code:**
  - [View Gesture Control Code](./ejercicios/12_gestos_webcam_mediapipe/)
- **Personal Comments:**
  - **Learning:** This was an excellent introduction to the power of pre-trained models like MediaPipe. The primary learning was in translating raw landmark coordinates into robust, meaningful gestures. Implementing the minigame logic was a great exercise in managing application state and event detection.
  - **Challenges:** The main technical challenge was devising a reliable logic for counting fingers, especially the thumb. For the minigame, tuning the gesture thresholds for a responsive but not overly sensitive interaction was key.
